rename index.ts to index.ts

./play/index.ts

[flow-field-effect] light mode use dark tailwind color

# binary-tree-grid-layout

[binary-tree-grid-layout] use tailwind color

[binary-tree-grid-layout] show preorder and postorder

# graph-force-directed-layout

# tree-layered-layout

# tree-horizontal-vertical-layout

# tree-radial-layout
